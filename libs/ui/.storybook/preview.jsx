// To control the way stories are rendered and add global decorators and parameters,
// create a .storybook/preview.js file.  This is loaded in the Canvas tab, the “preview”
// iframe that renders your components in isolation. Use preview.js for global code
// (such as CSS imports or JavaScript mocks) that applies to all stories.
